(everyone cheers and confetti shoots up from the ground as Mr. Krabs wields a shovel. He digs a hole, and then hops into it) No free refills.

His pineapple wilts and dies) I'm ready... (we see his gravestone behind the stand, that says \"R.I.P. I'M READY\". There is a vacant spot where his pineapple previously was. SpongeBob wakes up at the stand and sees that that was a dream) Patrick, how long have we been sitting here?"}

{"prompt": "How can you make money with such a stupid idea? SpongeBob:", "completion": "At first we didn't know what to do with all the money.

{"prompt": "I bet you miss Squidward... and the grill. And the crow's nest. SpongeBob:", "completion": "Yeah. Yeah! And do you know what I miss the most, Mr. Krabs? That tiny squeaky sound you get when you rub two pickles together. You know what I mean, Mr. Krabs?"}
{"prompt": "Uhh... Uh-yeah-uh-yes. Yes, I do, lad. Well, the Krusty Krab is only a short walk away. Why don't you head on down, for old time's sake?

While crowd-surfing, SpongeBob's surroundings turn into a pink sky with clouds) SpongeBob:", "completion": "Dreams do come true! (the crowd throws him on the ground in front of the Krusty Krab, where he floats up and kisses the building. We see him cheer in the dining area, kiss the floor, throw buns up into the air in the kitchen, laugh over the phone in Mr. Krabs' office, and stand at the ordering boat, the whole Krusty Krab cleaned and refreshed.

{"prompt": "SpongeBob, did you hear that? SpongeBob:", "completion": "I think it came from Sandy's tree."}
{"prompt": "That is one tired tree. SpongeBob:", "completion": "Let's check it out. (cut to inside Sandy's tree, where SpongeBob and Patrick come in. They both gasp) Look what's in Sandy's bed!

{"prompt": "That's not disturbing.Thisis disturbing. (struggles to create a talking face that protrudes from his back) Hi there, Sponge...Bob. My name is... PatBack! SpongeBob:", "completion": "Ha! Thatisreally disturbing! (the two laugh uncontrollably. Cut to Sandy. Her eye shoots open. A giant shadow looms over SpongeBob and Patrick. Patrick stops laughing, while SpongeBob continues to laugh)"}
{"prompt": "Umm, SpongeBob? SpongeBob:", "completion": "(stops laughing) Huh? (Sandy is really mad now; she's steaming red and roaring. SpongeBob and Patrick run, but Sandy has them both by the britches. They run in mid-air anyway)"}
{"prompt": "Faster, SpongeBob! She's gaining on us! SpongeBob:", "completion": "Sandy, no! Stop!"}
{"prompt": "I warned ya, Dirty Dan! Now you've just crossed the border into Hurtville! SpongeBob:", "completion": "Sandy, it's us! Your friends, SpongeBob and Patrick!"}
{"prompt": "Fun's over. SpongeBob:", "completion": "Whew, we sure don't want to wake her up again. Too bad we don't have any earplugs to put on her."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, all's I got is this bellybutton lint. (takes the lint out of its designated area. It somehow forms into the shape of earmuffs) SpongeBob:", "completion": "All right, Pat! (takes the earmuffs and crawls over to the bed. Patrick follows. Puts the earmuffs on Sandy)"}
{"prompt": "I'm gonna rip your arms off...flapjacks. (snores) SpongeBob:", "completion": "Well, that oughta work."}

{"prompt": "You-ll na-ver catch me! (giggles. Makes a snowball and throws it at SpongeBob's face. They both laugh. Starts to make another one, but he's hit by a giant mound of snow, which SpongeBob fired from a giant snow cannon) Hey, that's not fair! Cowboys couldn't afford cannons. SpongeBob:", "completion": "They couldn't afford station wagons either! (shoots one out at Patrick)"}
{"prompt": "Nice paneling. SpongeBob:", "completion": "All right, Pinhead. Your time is up! (cut to Patrick, who looks like a cone-head)"}
{"prompt": "Who you calling Pinhead? (shows a face of Patrick looking like a dork) I want to be Dirty Dan! SpongeBob:", "completion": "What makes you think you can be Dirty Dan?"}
{"prompt": "I'm dirty... dagle! (gets hit on the head by a giant snow shovel that SpongeBob has) SpongeBob:", "completion": "I say I'm Dirty Dan. (Patrick runs off and returns with a giant bat with a nail in it, made of snow. He whacks SpongeBob with it)"}
{"prompt": "Uh... I am? (Sandy slaps Patrick all the way across the treedome) SpongeBob:", "completion": "Patrick! (Patrick slams against the dome. Little drumsticks float around his head)"}
{"prompt": "Okay, Pinhead Larry, now you get yours! (SpongeBob screams loudly and runs off. Pounds the ground where he was standing; bellowing)PINHEAAAAAAAD!!!(SpongeBob whimpers and runs. Sandy is close behind. SpongeBob later doesn't seem to be going far because he's right in front of Sandy on the exercise wheel. He slips and gets flung across the wheel. He flies off and slams into the picnic table, leaving a giant crater in its place. Leans over the crater) Now you're gonna pay for those crimes, Pinhead! (SpongeBob picks up a wooden board) SpongeBob:", "completion": "Sandy, stay back. I'm warning ya! (Sandy roars right in SpongeBob's face) Okay, I warned ya! (throws the wooden board. Patrick pops up for no reason)"}
{"prompt": "Okay, SpongeBob, you can be Dirty Dan. I just want to be Patrick! SpongeBob:", "completion": "Let's get out of here before Sandy wakes up again! (the two run to the door, and SpongeBob tries his best to open it. Arm loses its grip and smacks Patrick in the face) Sorry Patrick, but the door is slippery! It's frozen shut!"}
{"prompt": "Let me have a try. (goes up to the door and spits on both hands, preparing to open the door) Open sesame! (nothing happens. Patrick shrugs) Well, I've done all I can do. SpongeBob:", "completion": "Then we're stuck in here, until the door thaws... in spring."}
{"prompt": "Barnacles! (cross-fade to much later, where SpongeBob and Patrick are completely buried in snow, shivering and blue) Is it spring yet? SpongeBob:", "completion": "N-n-n-no. (Patrick and SpongeBob's snow covering on their faces breaks off)"}
{"prompt": "I'm so cold that I'm shivering! (a piece of Patrick's side of his head cracks off, revealing his brain) SpongeBob:", "completion": "I'm so cold that I can use my nose drippings as a pair of chopsticks! (snaps off his two nose drippings and clicks them together)"}
{"prompt": "I'm so cold that... I'm shivering! SpongeBob:", "completion": "Maybe we should build a fire. I got it! We'll burn the bark from Sandy's tree! (begins to pull a strip of bark off the tree, but he's stopped by Sandy's booming voice)"}
{"prompt": "(off-screen) You're gonna be wearing an iron lung when I'm through with you, Pinhead! (quickly puts the strip back on and masking-tapes it on. Goes back to Patrick) SpongeBob:", "completion": "The fire's not going to happen, Patrick. I don't get it! How does Sandy survive these intense conditions every year?"}
{"prompt": "Maybe she just ignores it. SpongeBob:", "completion": "Maybe..."}
{"prompt": "Maybe... SpongeBob:", "completion": "Maybe it's her fur! (cut to a shot of a real-life squirrel)"}
{"prompt": "Maybe it's her fur! (cut to a shot of a real-life squirrel) SpongeBob:", "completion": "Look at all that warm, toasty fur!"}
{"prompt": "It's like a gold mine... but with fur. (SpongeBob ever so slowly goes to pluck a hair off Sandy) SpongeBob:", "completion": "Carefully... carefully... (Patrick smacks him)"}
{"prompt": "Come on, do it! I'm freezing here! SpongeBob:", "completion": "All right, all right, hang on a second! (plucks one hair off, and Sandy jumps up from her sleep and roars ferociously. Then she goes back to sleep) That should be enough, right? (Patrick takes the hair)"}
{"prompt": "Sponge, I'm a big man. A big...BIG man! SpongeBob:", "completion": "Well, I guess I've lived a full life! (plucks one more hair, causing the same reaction with Sandy)"}
{"prompt": "This is taking too long! I want the warm now! (takes a piece of masking tape) SpongeBob:", "completion": "Pat, no! (Patrick places the masking tape on Sandy and rips it off, leaving a long hole where her fur used to be. Sandy roars and goes back to sleep) Pat, are you crazy? (we see Patrick has placed the fur on his forehead)"}
{"prompt": "No, I'm warm. SpongeBob:", "completion": "Lemme see that roll of tape. (as we pan out from the tree, we hear the tape ripping out Sandy's fur and her roaring. Fade to later, where Patrick comes out of the tree with a strip of hair on his forehead and his pants full of fur. SpongeBob comes out with a weird fur hairdo and a goatee)"}
{"prompt": "Man, that fur really hits the spot! No more frozen armpits. (lifts his arm up, revealing fur under it) SpongeBob:", "completion": "And this eyebrow/goatee combo works like a charm. This is the best idea we ever had."}
{"prompt": "You said it! SpongeBob:", "completion": "I'm ready for the longest, coldest winter ever!"}
{"prompt": "I'm ready for the longest, coldest winter ever! SpongeBob:", "completion": "Spring?"}
{"prompt": "(yawns) Wow, spring already? (SpongeBob and Patrick run frantically to the door, but it hasn't thawed yet) SpongeBob:", "completion": "Tartar Sauce! The lock is still frozen!"}
{"prompt": "(off-screen) I sure can't wait to get outside and warm my fur! (SpongeBob and Patrick frantically blow on the door handle until it melts. Sandy peeks out the window) Oh look, it's SpongeBob and Patrick! (with that, Sponge and Patrick start screaming, trying to open the door) Hi guys! (walks over. Sees all the different fur assortments the two are wearing. Looks down at herself in her bikini, sees that all her fur is gone and screams in terror) SpongeBob:", "completion": "It's okay, Sandy. Squirrel pattern baldness is quite common in small mammals! (Patrick hides his furry forehead piece. Sandy is really ticked now)"}
{"prompt": "(turns red) SpongeBob... Patrick... SpongeBob:", "completion": "Don't worry, Sandy, we've got you covered. (giggles nervously. Fade to Sandy's arm pouring some lemonade. She giggles)"}
{"prompt": " SpongeBob:", "completion": " Oh, I've got ya now, Gary"}
{"prompt": " Meow? (SpongeBob jumps up and lands in mid-air. He touches Gary's shell with his index finger) SpongeBob:", "completion": " Tag, you're it! (runs off. Jumps and he opens his mouth. Flies to his house and chomps down on the side of it, leaving him clinging; garbled) Gary will never find me here! (Gary crawls over the ground, up the house and toward SpongeBob) Uh-oh. (Gary's eye substitutes as an arm as he tags SpongeBob)"}
{"prompt": " Meow. SpongeBob:", "completion": " Tag! Now I'm it! (laughs uncontrollably as he slides down the wall, scraping off two slices of the covering with his teeth. Patrick is below and SpongeBob takes the shavings out of his teeth)"}
{"prompt": " Hi SpongeBob, what are you doing? SpongeBob:", "completion": " Gary and I are playing tag, you wanna join us?"}
{"prompt": " Oh boy, would I! SpongeBob:", "completion": " (slyly) Okay. (touches him) Tag, you're it! (walks away)"}
{"prompt": " I'm it! I'm it, I'm it, I'm it, I'm it! (Gary is still there, and he meows. Patrick tags him) Tag, you're it! I win, I win! (Gary purrs and rubs against Patrick. He crawls all around Patrick's body. SpongeBob walks over) What's with Gary? He sounds like a motorboat! (laughs) SpongeBob:", "completion": " That's just a snail's way of saying he likes you!"}
{"prompt": " (laughs) It tickles! (the two laugh endlessly as Gary continues to crawl around. They continue laughing until it's dark) SpongeBob:", "completion": " Well, I guess it's time for me and the Gar-Bear to get going. Come on, Gary. (pulls Gary off of Patrick and walks away) Boy, I can't wait to hit the hay. (Patrick waves) What about you, Gary? (sees that he's no longer holding Gary) Gary? Gary? (cut to Patrick's house where the rock is up and Patrick is brushing his teeth and looking in a mirror on the side of the wall. He has his nightcap on)"}
{"prompt": " Well, I guess it's time for me and the Gar-Bear to get going. Come on, Gary. (pulls Gary off of Patrick and walks away) Boy, I can't wait to hit the hay.

{"prompt": " (we see Gary attached to his stomach) Nope. (looks down) Oh, hey, here he is! (Gary purrs and meows) SpongeBob:", "completion": " Come on, Gary, we gotta let Patrick go to sleep."}
{"prompt": " Well, I don't mind SpongeBob. In fact, why don't you Gary stay over at my house tonight? SpongeBob:", "completion": " Hey, that's a great idea!"}
{"prompt": " A sleepover! Oh boy, oh boy! This is gonna be great, Gary. We can stay up till dawn and watch scary movies and eat popcorn and play board games... (SpongeBob thinks to himself and we hear Patrick in the background saying \"Blah blah blah blah...\") SpongeBob:", "completion": " (thinking) Gee, this is great. My two best friends in the whole sea having a sleepover."}
{"prompt": " And then we'll make a house of cards, and then we'll read some comic books... SpongeBob:", "completion": " Okay, you two have a good time. I'll see you tomorrow. (they wave good-bye and SpongeBob walks home)"}
{"prompt": " Blah blah blah blah blah... (fade to Bikini Atoll at night, which soon becomes day. SpongeBob wakes up to his foghorn alarm clock) SpongeBob:", "completion": " I'm awake!"}
{"prompt": " (off-screen) Hey, SpongeBob! (SpongeBob leaps up and runs to the window. Patrick and Gary are outside) SpongeBob:", "completion": " Hey guys, how was the sleepover?"}
{"prompt": " Great, SpongeBob. Watch this! Wherever I go, Gary follows! (pulls Gary off his chest and runs. Gary goes after him as he runs around SpongeBob's house. Runs on top of his house and falls off and continues running, which Gary then imitates) See? (SpongeBob jumps from the window and runs off) SpongeBob:", "completion": " Come on, Gary! Try and catch meeee! (laughs) Isn't this great, Gary? Me running around and you chasing me? (notices he's not being chased) You're not chasing me. (Gary is still with Patrick)"}
{"prompt": " Come on, Gary, let's play a different game. (he and Gary walk away. SpongeBob jumps in front of Gary) SpongeBob:", "completion": " Who-ho-ho-ho! Look out! I'm right in front of... (Gary crawls away after Patrick) ...you... What's wrong with me? (sniffs his armpit) Do I offend? (Patrick is playing with Gary. Gary is crawling on Patrick's toes. Patrick is on his back and laughing while Gary purrs. SpongeBob runs inside the house and quickly brings out a ball covered in snail slime) Hey, Gary! Gary, look! It's your favorite ball! (Gary is sitting on Patrick's bum and Patrick shakes it, laughing. Drops the ball. Gary is now crawling up to Patrick's armpit. SpongeBob pulls a can ofSnail Nip) Hey, Gary, look! Snail Nip! (eats some) Huh? Huh-huh? (Gary is too busy crawling on Patrick's head to notice. SpongeBob decides to try something else. Runs inside and hangs from the window by his head) Help, Gary, help! Help me! Oh merciful Neptune! I closed the window on my head! (Gary is on his shell rolling Patrick left and right) All right, that's it! (the window opens and SpongeBob falls. Gary is now rolling on Patrick's belly. SpongeBob walks up to them) Gary, you stop this foolishness, right now. (Gary's eyes lower) Gary the snail, answer me when I'm talking to you! Okay, that's it, mister! You are coming home with me right this instant! (struggles and pulls Gary off of Patrick) Say goodbye to Patrick, Gary. (walks off. Cut to Gary)"}
{"prompt": " Hold it right there, DadMom AngryPants! SpongeBob:", "completion": " What's that supposed to mean?"}
{"prompt": " I don't know, but I do know Gary knows who he wants to go with. So I suggest that you put him down and let him choose.

{"prompt": "(swipes the case from him) Really? Everything? SpongeBob:", "completion": "A suit? Wonder where I could get a suit. (bubble-wipe to the Bikini Bottom Court House. Cut to the courtroom.

{"prompt": "What?! SpongeBob:", "completion": "Allow me to rephrase the question. Can you tell the court of some instance of Mr. Krabs' generosity in any way?"}
{"prompt": "(looking scared, with the frowning audience, he starts taking a nail and hammer and tries to open the briefcase) Must...open...case. (SpongeBob is questioning something else) SpongeBob:", "completion": "So it was you who made the floor slippery, wasn't it? (the questioned is a mop and does not answer him) Answer the question! Need I remind you that you, sir are under oath?"}

SpongeBob:", "completion": "(gasps) Mr. Krabs, I'm surprised at you. We can't give up just because things look bleak. This trial will be won by what's in your heart, not what's in this dumb old case.

{"prompt": "It's... (it is shown that the thing inside the briefcase is a Krabby Patty) It's just his lunch. Or is it?

SpongeBob:", "completion": "Are you sure it wasn't to make off with one of these? (shows Plankton the Krabby Patty. Plankton starts licking \nhis lips) Gotcha. Weren't you there to steal the formula of the most delicious, sweet smelling sandwich known to Bikini \nBottom? Krabby Patty."}
{"prompt": "Thank you, SpongeBob. I was foolish not to accept your help from the beginning. SpongeBob:", "completion": "That's OK, Mr. Krabs. I made you a present."}
{"prompt": "A present? For me? SpongeBob:", "completion": "Close your eyes and hold out your hand. (Mr. Krabs does so. Gives Mr. Krabs a \"wet floor\" sign with \nmany nails in it. Mr. Krabs grabs it and starts yelping in pain) It's a \"wet floor\" sign. I made it myself."}

{"prompt": " Meow. SpongeBob:", "completion": " What was that?"}
{"prompt": " Meow. SpongeBob:", "completion": " Oh, Gary, that distracting sound came from you. I'm sorry I can't play with you right now. Mermaid Man needs me. (when he tries the paddleball again, Gary interrupts)"}

{"prompt": " Meow. SpongeBob:", "completion": " So, let's get this straight, Gary. You don't want me to defeat the Dirty Bubble. You know, Dirty Bubble -- terror of the seven seas, arch nemesis of my favorite TV superheroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, and apparently renowned paddleball champion.

(Gary slithers off) Pets - sometimes I wonder if they understand a word you're saying. (Gary jumps on SpongeBob’s face, making him run around and scream) Gary, I hate it when you do that. Now get! (throws him away) And leave your master to his important affairs. (Gary rolls into his bowl and sees a crumb of food left. A bunch of spiders crawl out of it. Gary packs his things) Hey, I got one! Dirty Bubble, say your prayers."}
{"prompt": " (drinks his coffee then eats the cup) I haven't seen SpongeBob in a couple days. I'm sure he'll be glad to know I remembered what I wanted to tell him.

{"prompt": " What is it, buddy? You can tell me. SpongeBob:", "completion": " I took the Dirty Bubble challenge."}
{"prompt": " You what? (cries) SpongeBob:", "completion": " Why are you crying, Patrick?"}
{"prompt": " Because... many years ago, I took that challenge. SpongeBob:", "completion": " Really?"}
{"prompt": " Uh-huh. SpongeBob:", "completion": " What happened?"}
{"prompt": " I won. But then I lost the trophy they sent me. SpongeBob:", "completion": " You lost the...? That's terrible! Come on, Pat. Let's have some kelp cookies and some sea horse milk -- that \nalways cheers me up when I've lost something. There you are, Pat-- fresh sea horse milk."}
{"prompt": " Thanks, buddy. SpongeBob:", "completion": " Hey, Pat, you ever feel like you're forgetting something? Something important? (trips over Gary's bowl) Hmmm. I think it has something to do with this bowl. Gary's food bowl. That's it -- I gotta feed Gary. (gets the bag of snail food \noutside) That's a lot of dust for a couple of hours. (brings it in and pours it in Gary's bowl) Gary! Dinner! (takes out a \ntriangle) Come on, Gary, soup's on. Gary? Hey, Pat?"}

{"prompt": " Huh? SpongeBob:", "completion": " I can't find Gary. (cut to Gary slithering across the sand. Echoing howls are heard. Gary looks at his stomach and it's howling at him. Gary sneezes)"}
{"prompt": " Meow. (cut to SpongeBob) SpongeBob:", "completion": " This never fails-- Gary's favorite treats. Gary can't resist these babies. They're filled with eight types of \norganic sediment that bottom feeders like Gary can't get enough of."}
{"prompt": " Eight? SpongeBob:", "completion": " Yeah, something like that. All you really have to do is shake the can. Gary comes running every time. Pat, try \nit.

{"prompt": " I only tasted six types of sediment. (cut to nighttime where SpongeBob and Patrick are searching for Gary. Patrick \nis shaking his belly) SpongeBob:", "completion": " Gary? Gary! Gary, where are you? Are you under here? (lifts a flower up) Gary! Keep shaking, Patrick."}
{"prompt": " Oh. (jiggles his belly) SpongeBob:", "completion": " Gary!"}
{"prompt": " Gary! SpongeBob:", "completion": " You check over there. I'll check in here. (checks in the bathtub Squidward is in) Find him yet, Pat?"}
{"prompt": " (pulls the sink out from the wall, making water shoot out everywhere) No, but I'll keep looking. SpongeBob:", "completion": " But there's nowhere left to look."}
{"prompt": " There's one place we haven't checked. (cut to SpongeBob and Patrick standing in front of a mailbox full of letters) SpongeBob:", "completion": " I doubt Gary could fit in there."}
{"prompt": " Can't hurt to look. SpongeBob:", "completion": " Here goes nothing. (opens the mailbox and a bunch of letters shoot out and a rolled up paper falls on the ground) Look, Pat!"}
{"prompt": " What is it? SpongeBob:", "completion": " Let's see. \"Dear SpongeBob: These last few years have been some of the best of my life, but I must move on. \nDon't bother to come looking for me. By now, I have probably found a new owner who actually remembers to fill up my food \nbowl every now and again. Sincerely, Gary.

{"prompt": " (grabs SpongeBob’s mouth) That's enough, boy. See it's not always what you say that matters. Sometimes it's what \nyou don't say. Understand? SpongeBob:", "completion": " Yes, Mr. Krabs. I should've told Gary how important he was to me."}
{"prompt": " Well, I don't know what that has to do with making Krabby Patties, but I do know this: any problem you have can \nbe solved with a little hard work. SpongeBob:", "completion": " You're right, Mr. Krabs."}
{"prompt": " That's me boy! SpongeBob:", "completion": " If I'm going to find Gary, I'm going to need to work harder at it. (cut to Patrick sleeping on the ground. A \nbunch of things fall on Patrick and wake him up)"}

{"prompt": " (swallows a mouth-full of sand) When did the fun go away, SpongeBob? SpongeBob:", "completion": " It went away when you jumped off that cliff and knocked your head clean off."}
{"prompt": " That's it! (runs off) SpongeBob:", "completion": " That's what? What are you doing?"}
{"prompt": " I'm going to duplicate my actions from that day to ascertain the origin of my cha...an...ge! (falls off cliff) SpongeBob:", "completion": " Patrick! Hold on, buddy!

SpongeBob:", "completion": " But if that's your head, then what did I pick up over... (sign says 'Brain Coral Field') ...brain coral! No wonder you got so smart, buddy. (blows off the poison sea urchins off Patrick's head) Here you go, Patrick, your old head. Are you sure you want to give up being smart and phosisticated to be my friend again?"}
{"prompt": " Knowledge can never replace friendship. I prefer to be an idiot! SpongeBob:", "completion": " Not just an idiot, Patrick. You're also my pal. (takes off Patrick's head and puts his old one back on) Patrick? Say something, Patrick."}

(throws snow globe into a room full of Plankton's past schemes then locks the door) Now nobody's getting to see anything. Don't you understand this is all part of his ruse. It's just cosmetic. He thinks he \ncan take us out. But we'll show him. We're gonna out-fake the faker. Well, it looks like old Plankton is really going through with it. I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore. Yup, we sure whipped him this time. Okay, boys, the coast is clear. Plankton's turned over a new leaf. SpongeBob:", "completion": " That's some good news, Mr. Krabs."}

{"prompt": " Fine?! (grabs SpongeBob's mouth and ties it up) Today's not the day for that word, boy. Not after I received this letter from the Fry Cooks Union.

{"prompt": " (stops SpongeBob) He was and is. I thought I told you to take a vacation, boy. SpongeBob:", "completion": " What's a vacation?"}
{"prompt": " Well, a vacation is when you don't come into work. SpongeBob:", "completion": " (gasps) No work?! But what'll I do all day?"}
{"prompt": " Oh, I really don't know. Just go have fun or whatever. I really don't care. You just can't be here. SpongeBob:", "completion": " But who will fry the patties and clean the grill while I'm gone? Squidward can't do it all alone."}

{"prompt": " Alright, but lunch only. If you so much as touch a spatuler, you'll be vacationing in Davy Jones' Locker. SpongeBob:", "completion": " You have my word, sir. No working. (enters kitchen) Hey Pat, it's time for your lunch-- (screams as he sees Patrick putting patties wrongly, attached to his body, on the grill) Whoa! Patrick, you can't do that!"}
{"prompt": " Huh? SpongeBob:", "completion": " You need to turn up the grill to exactly 298 degrees Fahrenheit. (turns the knob to the right from 297 to 298. Takes the spatula) Patrick, this is no way to treat a Krabby Patty."}
{"prompt": " (storms into the kitchen) SpongeBob! What did I tell you before about working? SpongeBob:", "completion": " Wait, it's not what you think."}
{"prompt": " (wheels SpongeBob on a dolly) Out you go, boy. SpongeBob:", "completion": " But my knowledge could help Patrick maintain the high standards of the Krusty Krab."}

SpongeBob:", "completion": " Mr. Krabs is right. In order to enjoy my vacation, I need to stay away from work. Physically and mentally. (looks at his net) Hey, that reminds me of...yeah. (his net turns into a spatula. Pretends to grill but stops) Hold it right there, Mr. WorkaholicPants. You're on vacation. You just need to sit down and relax. (floats onto the ground) That's more like it. Just sit back and watch the clouds. (watches a cloud go by, resembling a jellyfish) That one's a jellyfish!

A delivery fish gets out with the same buns on a plate)"}
{"prompt": " Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? (SpongeBob slips through phone cord and through Patrick's head but shoots himself out of the Krusty Krab, through the doors. Cut to the Krusty Krab restroom where Patrick is cleaning out his ear) Hmm, I didn't even know I had an ear. (notices water splashing out from the toilet behind him) Hey, I just cleaned that one. SpongeBob:", "completion": " Patrick, shhh."}
{"prompt": " It talks! Ahh! (runs out) SpongeBob:", "completion": " Somebody help me, I'm stuck. (Mr. Krabs walks up) Mr. Krabs! Thank Neptune it's you. I'm in a bit of a fix here.

Why would Mr. Krabs try so hard to get rid of me. I'm only on vacation. Unless, it's a... (gasps) ...permanent vacation. That's it! Mr. Krabs wants to replace me. Oh, I should've known. Patrick's had his eye on my \njob all along. He's been scheming. They think I'm outdated. They think I'm all washed up. Well, I'll show them. (cut to Patrick running down the street to his rock)"}

{"prompt": " Bumping barnacles, yes. (laughs and holds up a dime) And there she is. SpongeBob:", "completion": " Wow! That's more than I make in a year."}
{"prompt": " Don't be askin' me for a raise. Just get back to work. SpongeBob:", "completion": " (jumps out of the Patrick costume) Yippee! I happily acquiesce."}

{"prompt": " I guess that ride was too much for the little guy. (bubble-wipe to SpongeBob and Patrick standing in line by the Fiery Fist O' Pain) SpongeBob:", "completion": " Well, the line looks a little bit shorter now. Can you believe that some people are scared of this ride? (both chuckle nervously)"}

{"prompt": " No, Patrick, thank you. SpongeBob:", "completion": " (philosophically) Fret not, my friend, for I have learned the truth. It matters not whether one is dirty or clean, for can cleanliness exist without filthiness, and would we know filthiness without cleanliness?

{"prompt": "You're in charge for the next 15 minutes. SpongeBob:", "completion": "I'm...in charge?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, sure, why not? (SpongeBob starts shaking) You okay, boy? SpongeBob:", "completion": "(flies around, leaving a rainbow trail behind) Yahow! (lands and salutes) I won't let you down, sir."}
{"prompt": "What a sheesh. I'll be back in 15 minutes (leaves. Squidward is sleeping and SpongeBob wakes him up) SpongeBob:", "completion": "Naptime's over, Squidward. Now what do you say we work real hard until Mr. Krabs comes back?"}
{"prompt": " SpongeBob:", "completion": " Hello?"}
{"prompt": " Hey, SpongeBob? How's it going? SpongeBob:", "completion": " Oh, hiya, Sandy!"}
{"prompt": " Hey, listen, I was wondering if you could come by tonight. SpongeBob:", "completion": " Sure! What's up?"}
{"prompt": " I whipped up an invention I'm gonna unveil tonight in front of my comrades, and I need you to be my test subject. SpongeBob:", "completion": " I will be there!"}
{"prompt": " You're not gonna forget, are ya? SpongeBob:", "completion": " Of course not! Have I ever let you down before? (silence) Hello?"}
{"prompt": " (leaning foward through the split screen [breaking the fourth wall]) Just be here! (pulls the split screen shut) SpongeBob:", "completion": " With Gary as my witness, I won't let you down, Ms. Cheeks! (bubble-wipe to him walking to the Krusty Krab; chanting) I won't let Sandy down! I won't let Sandy down! I won't let Sandy down! (inside, Mr. Krabs is sitting at a table trying to assemble a \"Build-Your-Own-Telescope\" kit)"}
{"prompt": " Oh, how do you put this thing together? (SpongeBob passes Krabs and walks into the kitchen) SpongeBob:", "completion": " I won't let Sandy down! I won't let Sandy down! Good morning, cap'n! I won't let Sandy down! I won't let Sandy down, down! Right after work I'm going over to Sandy's, who I'm not gonna let down."}
{"prompt": " Boy? SpongeBob:", "completion": " Yes, sir?"}
{"prompt": " I've got a special assignment for you. This is a build-it-yourself telescope. The only problem is, I can't figure out how to put the darn thing together. That's where you come in. (pushes a book at him) SpongeBob:", "completion": " \"Telescope Assembly Manual\"..."}
{"prompt": " Now read this cover-to-cover, and be prepared to put this together at me house tonight. SpongeBob:", "completion": " Tonight?"}
{"prompt": " That's not gonna be a problem, is it? SpongeBob:", "completion": " Umm... Well, actually..."}
{"prompt": " Excellent! Because I was looking at your annual employee report card... (puts on reading glasses and looks at a sheet of paper, where such tasks as \"Keeps Work Area Clean\", \"Arrives at Work on Time\" and \"Keeps up on Hygiene\" are checked under \"Annual Employee Report for SpongeBob SquarePants\". The only one unmarked is \"Does a Laborious Task for Supervisor\") ...and it appears the \"Does Laborious Task for Supervisor\" box is unchecked. (SpongeBob gasps) See ya tonight! SpongeBob:", "completion": " What am I gonna do? (Krabs leaves) You can do it. You made the commitments, you have to honor them. Both of them."}
{"prompt": " (offscreen) Who're you talking to, buddy? (appears and SpongeBob accidentally flings a patty over his eyes, blindly bumping into Patrick) SpongeBob:", "completion": " Oh, hiya, Patrick. What're you doing back here? (puts the patty in his pants)"}
{"prompt": " Sorry to disturb you during work hours. I just wanted to remind you about my birthday. SpongeBob:", "completion": " No need to remind me! I wouldn't forget about my best buddy's birthday!"}
{"prompt": " Then why aren't you saying the words? SpongeBob:", "completion": " What words?"}
{"prompt": " \"Happy birthday\"! It's today! My birthday's today! (SpongeBob deflates) Well, you surely must remember what you're gonna bring to my birthday, right? SpongeBob:", "completion": " Uhh..."}
{"prompt": " My birthday cake! SpongeBob:", "completion": " Tonight?"}
{"prompt": " Yes, tonight! Well, when else am I gonna celebrate it? At least I had the courtesy to start the party after my best friend got off of work. See ya tonight, buddy SpongeBob:", "completion": " Oh, Neptune! This is worse than I ever could've imagined! (bubble-wipe to 6 pm. SpongeBob removes his Krusty Krab hat) Right! Time to be all I can be! (runs to Sandy's treedome house in a tux and his usual water helmet. Tons of fish are there, and Sandy is up on a stage, in a purple dress, putting the final touches on her invention, which is still mostly covered by a veil except the part she is working on) Man, these people sure look sciencey. Sandy must be pulling out all the stops on this one. (walks up to Sandy) Hey, Sandy! Watcha doing?"}
{"prompt": " Hey, SpongeBob! Just putting the finishing touches on my invention. Thanks for assisting me! You're such a big help! No wonder Mr. Krabs relies on you so hevily. (SpongeBob gasps) SpongeBob:", "completion": " (quietly) I gotta help Mr. Krabs! Uh, Sandy, I gotta go to the, uh, gent's room. (leaves the Treedome, and stuffs his tux into the front of his pants, and the sleeves into the sides) Now, if I finish up with Mr. Krabs, that'll clear me up to assist Sandy! (runs over to Mr. Krabs' anchor house. Krabs sits on the living room floor with the kit.)"}
{"prompt": " SpongeBob! I knew I wouldn't have to fire ya! SpongeBob:", "completion": " You can rely on me, sir! I wouldn't wanna jeopordize my employee record. (laughs) OK, let's see what we got here. Oh, it says on page 472 section C-17 that you need a right-angled motorized hex drill to assemble this thing."}
{"prompt": " Really... Why don't you go into town and pick up one of those hex drill thingies. SpongeBob:", "completion": " I..."}
{"prompt": " Or you could sit there and watch me fill out your employee report card... (clicks his pen, and SpongeBob runs out into downtown Bikini Bottom. He slams into the door ofTom's Toolery. There is a note on the door) SpongeBob:", "completion": " (reading) \"Dear valued Tom's Toolery customers, we are closed this week in observance of Porpoise Day. Please call again.\" Barnacles! Where can I find a motorized hex drill now. (has flashback to Sandy holding one while finishing her invention)"}
{"prompt": " (in thought cloud) Just finishin' up here! (SpongeBob is about to run to Sandy's, when he slams into Patrick) SpongeBob:", "completion": " Heh, oh, hey, Patrick! What're you doing in town?"}
{"prompt": " I was just buying some birthday hats for my birthday party. (pulls out a transparent bag with a red hat, a green hat and a purple hat inside. He wears a purple one, and puts the red one on SpongeBob) You didn't forget my party, did you? SpongeBob:", "completion": " Forget? How can I forget my best friend's birthday party?"}
{"prompt": " You're already forgetting something! SpongeBob:", "completion": " Ha, ha! No, I haven't! ...Have I?"}
{"prompt": " Hello?! My birthday cake! SpongeBob:", "completion": " Oh, yeah, that! I w- I was just getting to that! That's why I was here in town! Forget your birthday cake! You're hilarious, Star, you really are! Now, you just go home, and I'll get your cake, you silly guy, you! (rounds the corner and darts off to the bakery, which is shaped like a muffin and run by a nasty old lady) Hi! I need a birthday cake!"}
{"prompt": " Oh, yeah, that! I w- I was just getting to that! That's why I was here in town! Forget your birthday cake! You're hilarious, Star, you really are!

I need a birthday cake! SpongeBob:", "completion": " (reading) \"Sorry About the Scabies\". Um, can you change it to say \"Happy Birthday\"?"}
{"prompt": " (reading) \"Sorry About the Scabies\". Um, can you change it to say \"Happy Birthday\"? SpongeBob:", "completion": " Yeah, here you are. (pays her and runs out with it just as the store closes, and runs by the Treedome on his way back, stopping in his tracks) Sandy's drill! (wriggles out of his pants, his tuxedo underneath, while still holding up his cake and kicks them into his back pocket. Inside the treedome, everyone is sitting in front of a stage, chatting impatiently, waiting for SpongeBob. He slips behind the stage and shifts through Sandy's toolbox)"}
{"prompt": " SpongeBob? SpongeBob:", "completion": " (startled) Oh, hi! I was just, uh, making sure you had your hardware!"}
{"prompt": " Well, that's an unusual getup. (looks at his birthday hat, which he forgot to take off.) SpongeBob:", "completion": " Oh, I just thought I'd be a little festive, you know, for the scientists..."}
{"prompt": " And the birthday cake? (SpongeBob shrugs and chuckles. But Sandy doesn't have time. She drags him onstage under a banner that says \"Night of Discovery\" and goes up to the podium to speak into a microphone) Greetings, my distinguished colleages! Tonight, you will witness an invention so revolutionary, it may change modern science forever! Now to demonstrate, my assistant will disrobe and enter the machine. SpongeBob:", "completion": " What? (Sandy hands him a hospital gown)"}
{"prompt": " Some of you may be wondering why the test subject is disrobing. It is because... (looks at SpongeBob with a horrified look) What's under your gown? (There is a bulge coming from the back of SpongeBob's outfit) SpongeBob:", "completion": " It must be thatspicy kelpI ate earlier. I gotta go use the lavatory. I'll be right back! (runs out and goes to Patrick's rock. Knocks and it opens) Happy birthday! (walks inside, and it slams shut on his arm)"}
{"prompt": " You finally made it! (slides his arm out) SpongeBob:", "completion": " Yeah, there was a, uhh... Big... Traffic... Storm."}
{"prompt": " Well, just leave my present over on the present table! (points to a sand table with a banner over it that says \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY MEE\". The \"P\"'s, \"R\", \"D\" and \"E\"'s are backwards. Spongy's eyes burn out in desperation) SpongeBob:", "completion": " Your present?"}
{"prompt": " I'm so excited; I've been waiting for a whole year! SpongeBob:", "completion": " I've got it, it's right here! (tears off a piece of his lab robe and wraps Sandy's drill with it)  Tada! See, all wrapped up and ready to go! (places it on the table)"}
{"prompt": " Well, what're you waiting for, buddy? Serve up the cake so I can tear into that present! SpongeBob:", "completion": " The cake! I must've left it at Sandy's!"}
{"prompt": " You took it to Sandy's? SpongeBob:", "completion": " No! I said \"The bakery delivers, isn't that dandy?\". In fact, I think I hear them right now outside! Wait there while I go check. (sneaks back into Sandy's Treedome and grabs the cake)"}
{"prompt": " SpongeBob! SpongeBob:", "completion": " Oh, barnacles. (goes back onstage with the cake)"}
{"prompt": " (in thought cloud) I was just looking at your employee report card... SpongeBob:", "completion": " (gasp) The telescope!"}
{"prompt": " Without further delay, I will now initiate the protosequence. (SpongeBob pops out of the machine.) SpongeBob:", "completion": " Uh, Sandy, I hate to delay the procedings, but, uh, I forgot to mail in this mail-in rebate and, uh... I'll be right back. (everyone looks on angrily as SpongeBob runs to Mr. Krabs house naked) OK, let's get started."}
{"prompt": " What happened to your clothes, boy? SpongeBob:", "completion": " Sardines! Yeah, I was attacked by a can of wild sardines. Now let's finish this telescope. (struggles to put together two pieces in a frenzy.)"}
{"prompt": " Boy? Hold on, boy, you're supposed to be using that motorized hex drill! Now, where is it? SpongeBob:", "completion": " Ugh! I left it at Patrick's rock!"}
{"prompt": " SpongeBob, why are your clothes invisible? SpongeBob:", "completion": " Nevermind that, could I please borrow your present?"}
{"prompt": " No, no, you can't borrow my birthday present! SpongeBob:", "completion": " Not even for a minute?"}
{"prompt": " No, not 'till you deliver my birthday cake. SpongeBob:", "completion": " OK, I'll be right back! (darts off again.)"}
{"prompt": " Hold on, where're you going? (Mr. Krabs catches up, and he and Patrick follow SpongeBob to the Treedome) SpongeBob:", "completion": " I'm right here! (out of breath, he pants up to the stage, grabs the cake and is about to leave when Sandy stops him)"}
{"prompt": " That looks like my power drill! You've got a lot of explaining to do, mister! (everyone is shouting) SpongeBob:", "completion": " (drowned out) I've got something to say. I've got something to say. I've got so-- I HAVE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY!"}
{"prompt": " (drowned out) I've got something to say. I've got something to say. I've got so-- I HAVE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY! SpongeBob:", "completion": " I know you all had important things tonight. Mr. Krabs, with your telescope. Patrick, your birthday. Sandy, you have this big presentation. I just couldn't say \"no\" to any of you."}
{"prompt": " We could've worked something out. SpongeBob:", "completion": " Aw. You know, you guys are right. It was silly to think I could be in 3 places at once."}
{"prompt": " SpongeBob:", "completion": "Patrick! (closes the door. Patrick's head falls down, which makes Patrick wake up) What are you doing out here, silly?"}
{"prompt": "I'm waiting for you, so we can play the day away. (notices SpongeBob's hat and grumbles) Barnacles! You're wearing that dumb hat, again! Every time you wear that stupid thing, you're gone for the whole day! SpongeBob:", "completion": "That's because this is my work hat, Patrick. I have to wear it when I go to work."}
{"prompt": "Why don't you just take it off? SpongeBob:", "completion": "(laughs) I'm afraid it doesn't work that way, buddy."}
{"prompt": "Oh no! He's got the hat, too! SpongeBob:", "completion": "Don't worry, Patrick. I'll be back from work at six. We can play then."}
{"prompt": "Perfect. You'll be wearin' that hat in no time at all. (walks into the Krusty Krab, watching Patrick) Hee hee hee. SpongeBob:", "completion": "What's shakin' Mr. K?"}
{"prompt": "You're buddy Patrick. I hired him to stand out there and hold that sign. SpongeBob:", "completion": "Oh, he is good."}
{"prompt": "SpongeBob, what's the matter with Patrick? SpongeBob:", "completion": "Patrick, what's the matter?"}
{"prompt": "Sometimes when I'm nervous, I forget how to stand! SpongeBob:", "completion": "He's nervous."}
{"prompt": "That's right! I think we've finally found a job you're good at: Being a absolute buffoon! (walks to tourists) If it's falling you crave, then it can be found exclusively at the Krusty Krab! For just $5. (five fingers appear on Mr. Krabs' claws. The tourists hand him money. Bubble-wipe to the Krusty Krab. Patrick falls and everybody is laughing and cheering) SpongeBob:", "completion": "Patrick, you alright?"}
{"prompt": "We've got all the entertainment we need, thank you very much! (points to Patrick, but he's not there) Hey, where'd he go? SpongeBob:", "completion": "(guiding Patrick, who has a tissue in his nose) That's it, buddy. Come on."}
{"prompt": "What's with him? SpongeBob:", "completion": "Patrick had a bloody nose, so I was going to walk him home."}
{"prompt": "Okay, let 'er rip! (Patrick falls headfirst into the pie; to Squidward) If the crowd gets bored, add more boxes! SpongeBob:", "completion": "Hey, Patrick... How are you feeling after your first day on the job?"}
{"prompt": "I feel like a million BUCKS... (falls over) SpongeBob:", "completion": "Patrick? Patrick, are you all right? Say something! (Patrick mumbles incoherently) OK, that's it! No best friend of mine is going to suffer permanent brain trauma just so Mr. Krabs can make a quick buck. I'm going to go have a talk with him right--"}
{"prompt": "(grabs SpongeBob) No! P-please, don't tell Mr Krabs! You don't understand. For years, people have been telling me, \"You're no good!\" Now I'm good! I have a hat to prove it! I don't wanna go back to being No Hat Patrick! (cries) SpongeBob:", "completion": "OK, buddy, I understand. Just promise me one thing."}
{"prompt": "What's that, pal? SpongeBob:", "completion": "Just be careful, hm?"}
{"prompt": "(hugs him) Thanks, pal. (bubble-wipe to SpongeBob walking to work) SpongeBob:", "completion": "I'm worried about Patrick. I'm not sure his new job is good for him. (enters the Krusty Krab, where Mr. Krabs is dressed in a suit and speaking through a megaphone. Above him is a diving board-like platform, and a bucket of spiked sea urchins is next to him)"}
{"prompt": "Step right up! See the part time minimum wage employee fall atop this tower into this bucket of spiny sea urchins! SpongeBob:", "completion": "PATRICK!"}
{"prompt": "(he is being hauled to the top of the platform) Hey SpongeBob. SpongeBob:", "completion": "Mr Krabs, you can't let him do this! He might get hurt!"}
{"prompt": "Ready! (prepares to dive from the platform) SpongeBob:", "completion": "Oh, I can't watch!"}
{"prompt": "I figured it out; it's the hat that makes me fall, it makes me top heavy! (cut to the urchin bucket, with the crowd watching. Squidward crashes into the urchin bucket. Patrick lands on top of him) SpongeBob:", "completion": "So it was your hat that was making you fall the whole time!"}
{"prompt": "Not even close, you're fired. (removes the hat from Patrick, who becomes teary-eyed) As long as I'm still standing, you will never wear this hat again! (walks away with the hat. Patrick cries) SpongeBob:", "completion": "(walks up to Patrick) Patrick, are you OK?"}
{"prompt": "Well, I guess it's back to being No Hat Pat! (sadly walks out of the Krusty Krab. A epilogue card appears) SpongeBob:", "completion": "(walking home with Patrick) It's okay, Patrick. Not everyone is equipped to bear the awesome weight of responsibility that a uniform hat represents. But you can wear mine any time you want."}
{"prompt": "Really? SpongeBob:", "completion": "Sure thing, pal. (gives Patrick his hat)"}
{"prompt": "(puts the hat on and falls over) Thanks, SpongeBob! You're the best! SpongeBob:", "completion": "Anytime, pal! Anytime!"}
{"prompt": " SpongeBob:", "completion": " Ohh. Patrick?"}
{"prompt": " Yeah? SpongeBob:", "completion": " What do you wanna do today?"}
{"prompt": " I don't know. SpongeBob:", "completion": " I guess we could play something."}
{"prompt": " I guess we could play something. SpongeBob:", "completion": " How about a yo-?"}
{"prompt": " No. SpongeBob:", "completion": "-yo? Buried treasure board game?"}
{"prompt": " Nah. SpongeBob:", "completion": " Dollies?"}

{"prompt": " Uh-uh. SpongeBob:", "completion": " Hey, we could play with our Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy action figures.(notices his Barnacle Boy action figure is covered in drool and chewed)Eww! Barnacle Boy's all chewed up. And slimy!"}
{"prompt": " Yeah, that'll happen. SpongeBob:", "completion": "(drops his figure and wipes the germs by his hole)Ohh! There is just nothing to play with!"}
{"prompt": " There's got to be something we could do. SpongeBob:", "completion": " Hi, Squidward! Can you think of anything fun we can do?"}
{"prompt": " We already thought of that one. SpongeBob:", "completion": " Mmm."}
{"prompt": "(reading from another sign)Here it is! SpongeBob:", "completion": "(reading from another sign)Welcome to Bikini Bottom's newest...Toy store?!"}
{"prompt": " Ohhh. SpongeBob:", "completion": " Well, we're here."}
{"prompt": " But, where's the toy store? SpongeBob:", "completion": " Well, I guess it's not open."}
{"prompt": " Mmm-hmm. SpongeBob:", "completion": " I got it."}

{"prompt": " Loooook!(Patrick looks up) SpongeBob:", "completion": "(gasps)Patrick, look at that!"}
{"prompt": "(gasps)Wow. SpongeBob:", "completion": " That depends. Tell me, do you like to sing?"}
{"prompt": " That depends. Tell me, do you like to sing? SpongeBob:", "completion": " La..."}
{"prompt": " La... SpongeBob:", "completion": "(singing)Toys! Glorious toys! La la la la! Toys! Yeah. Hey, Patrick."}
{"prompt": " Hey, SpongeBob. What's with the tutu? SpongeBob:", "completion": " It's not a tutu, it's a man-tu! You can tell because it has(manly voice)extra support. I got the last one."}
{"prompt": " Uh. Uhhhhhhhh! SpongeBob:", "completion": " What a great day! I hope it never ends!"}
{"prompt": " Never! SpongeBob:", "completion": " Aw, the store's closing. We'll have to leave now."}
{"prompt": " What part of never don't you understand? SpongeBob:", "completion": " Patrick, we have to leave."}
{"prompt": " I'm not moving. SpongeBob:", "completion": " But they'll just come and kick us out."}
{"prompt": " Not if we hide. SpongeBob:", "completion": " Hide? Is that kind of, sneaky?"}
{"prompt": " Oh, it's sneaky all right. Really sneaky.  C'mon. Haven't you always wanted to have a toy store all to yourself? SpongeBob:", "completion": " No. But, I do now. What do we do first?!"}
{"prompt": "(SpongeBob pops out)Uhhhh! SpongeBob:", "completion": " Thanks, pal. Well, we did it!"}
{"prompt": " Thanks, pal. Well, we did it! SpongeBob:", "completion": " Yay! Ha ha ha ha!"}
{"prompt": " Yay! This is so awesome! SpongeBob:", "completion": " Nothing can ruin it!"}

{"prompt": " Yeah, right SpongeBob. I let you down, we find the light switch, and everything turns out peachy! SpongeBob:", "completion": " Yes."}
{"prompt": " Look around you, SpongeBob! We're surrounded! SpongeBob:", "completion": " By toys?"}
{"prompt": " That want to get us! SpongeBob:", "completion": " Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"}
{"prompt": " Are we gonna hide in here for the rest of our lives? SpongeBob:", "completion": " No!"}
{"prompt": " Are we going to the ladies' room again? SpongeBob:", "completion": " No. We're going to fight back that monster for scaring the pants off of us, and most of all, we're gonna win!"}

{"prompt": " No. Besides, I don't really think my shins should be involved. (wiggling his foot) They're a bit flabby today. SpongeBob:", "completion": " That's shindig, buddy. We're spending the day at the beach in the honor of our best friendship."}
{"prompt": " The beach? Just you and me? (SpongeBob rips off his pants showing his swim trunks. Then Patrick tears off his skin, revealing his internal organs) So am I ready for the beach, SpongeBob? SpongeBob:", "completion": " Oh, sure. A little sunscreen and I'm sure you'll be fine. (bubble-wipe to outside where a bus stops.

{"prompt": " That soundsunboring.(Patrick hits his arm to SpongeBob) SpongeBob:", "completion": " No one's ever been annoyed by a sand castle. (laughs. Bubble-wipe to sometime later) Nothing quite like the joy of sand castling. (he is building a sandcastle. Talks to the man he has drawn in a window of his castle) Eh, buddy? How you doing over there?"}
{"prompt": " Everything's dandy in Patrick's Kingdom. (starts building a \"sandcastle\". Then he stops when SpongeBob talks) SpongeBob:", "completion": " Oh, a structure like that can't protect a king and his subjects. Here let me help you. First, you should start all over.

{"prompt": " What are you doing? You destroyed my castle! SpongeBob:", "completion": " I'm just trying to help, buddy."}
{"prompt": " Why, thank you. Here's a little something for you. (Patrick gives sand money to Billy. The sand breaks) SpongeBob:", "completion": " Well I suppose I should just tend to the affairs of my own realm. And I'll start by making a queen to rule by your side.

{"prompt": " Now, we're even. SpongeBob:", "completion": " All right Patrick. Have it your way. (draws a line in the sand separating the two of them) You keep to your territory and I'll keep to mine. (builds his sandcastle fast. Patrick looks at his blueprints and throws it away)"}
{"prompt": " Now this'll show SpongeBob that he's not the only one who can build a castle! (builds his sandcastle fast) Let see SpongeBob destroythiscastle. SpongeBob:", "completion": " I better build a wall just in case KingPinkygets any funny ideas. (builds the wall fast but then notices that Patrick's castle is over the borderline) Oh, sir. You built onto my side."}
{"prompt": " So? SpongeBob:", "completion": " So you don't do that! (chops off the portion of Patrick's castle that is crossing) There. That restores the integrity of our shared border."}

This is worse than I thought! (runs to get a broom and mop to hold the ceiling up) My door! (runs to the door with a chair to keep hold it up.

(gives SpongeBob the spatula and pushes him to the grill) Come on, now, cook! (SpongeBob starts to flip patties. He pauses and glances at Mr. Krabs before flipping the patty. Stops him) Ha! Ha ha! I knew it! You lifted a patty from one side, instead of straight up! What are you trying to do, sabotage me?! (takes the spatula and shoves him outside) Now you go home and get some rest!

And what kind of a bedtime story was that, anyway?"}
{"prompt": "(holds up the book. It has a picture of a excited fish with \"The Land of Perpetual Excitement\" above it) It's calledThe Land of Perpetual Excitement. You know, it's a \"get-out-of-bed\" story! SpongeBob:", "completion": "Patrick, I'm trying togo to sleep."}

SpongeBob gives Gary another Snail Bite and the camera pans over to Gary doing archery and SpongeBob gives another Snail Bite. They walk away from the target. We now see Gary lifting a 500 pound weight with his eyes and SpongeBob gives him a Snail Bite. Then Gary goes bowling and knocks all the pins over. SpongeBob then gives him a Snail Bite. Gary then jumps out of a plane and pull out the parachute. As he lands, SpongeBob gives him another Snail Bite. Gary then pulls a red curtain to reveal a marble sculpture and SpongeBob gives him a Snail Bite for it. Gary then performs a famous Houdini trick by being bind in a straight jacket and dunked in a tank of water where he struggles to escape. Cut to SpongeBob watching this act and Gary comes to him as SpongeBob gives him a Snail Bite. Gary then does a motorcycle stunt by driving over buses and going through a ring of fire.

SpongeBob:", "completion": "Gary, take a look at this map. (opens a map with pet stores all over the world marked on it) This is a map of every pet store in the entire world! We've been to every single one of them, Gary! And not one of them has the treats you are after! Not one! I can't keep looking, Gary. I just can't."}
{"prompt": "Hey, SpongeBob! Your snail's still meowing? I have experience with these situations. You're the sponge. He is the snail. You just have to say \"no\" in a very firm voice! SpongeBob:", "completion": "But I don't want to say no to my wittle Gare-Bear! I want him to be happy!"}

{"prompt": " SpongeBob:", "completion": " Kind of sounds like Squidward's practicing his clarinet over there. Doesn't it, Gary? Gary? Well, I can't just stand by and let him practice alone.

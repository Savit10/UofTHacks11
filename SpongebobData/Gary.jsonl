Then we see Gary jumping on 5 trampolines, going into a tunnel, and rolling down a slide. SpongeBob gives Gary another Snail Bite and the camera pans over to Gary doing archery and SpongeBob gives another Snail Bite. They walk away from the target. We now see Gary lifting a 500 pound weight with his eyes and SpongeBob gives him a Snail Bite. Then Gary goes bowling and knocks all the pins over. SpongeBob then gives him a Snail Bite. Gary then jumps out of a plane and pull out the parachute. As he lands, SpongeBob gives him another Snail Bite. Gary then pulls a red curtain to reveal a marble sculpture and SpongeBob gives him a Snail Bite for it. Gary then performs a famous Houdini trick by being bind in a straight jacket and dunked in a tank of water where he struggles to escape. Cut to SpongeBob watching this act and Gary comes to him as SpongeBob gives him a Snail Bite. Gary then does a motorcycle stunt by driving over buses and going through a ring of fire.

(tries to open the door, but Gary growls every time he tries to) Gary, is that a box of Snail Bites in your teeth? He-he. That's funny, because I think I just saw a half-full box in the kitchen.

{"prompt": "Gary, this won't be easy, but the time has come when I must say nee, nn... Oh, Gary, It's a photo, it's a framed photo of the moment I picked you up at the pound.
